<p>1.Its to never stop creating new design, an endless cycle. Ex-Redesign my website. This apply of creating a new look.</p>
	
<p>2.A good design to the product is useful in different situations but can help making it in the design world.Ex- a calender of the hurricane katrina for typography class. I would apply with creating an aesthetic design while still function as it should be.</p>
<p>3.The beauty of the design can impact the amount of time people would spend on. Ex- adding in javascript into my website like hovering effects, smooth transitions and shadow effects. I would apply to be more interactive to the web so that the user will enjoy the time spent in my web.</p>
<p>4.Have the design make your product easier to understand the function. Ex- Simplifying an object to be an icon. This apply with that easier to read as an icon when it's in small size.  </p>
<p>5.Dont think the design as one picture and have the design function as to what it is supposed to do. Ex- hovering on a button with little animation. This applies that my button is not art but a tool function relating to my website.</p>
<p>6.Don't focus too much on the design but the purpose of the function so consumers would not be disappointed to what the product is used. Ex- Creating a book in typography ll. Since its a type design, the design is how to show your information as clear as possible but the design doesnâ€™t affect it negatively.</p>
<p>7.Avoid using trend base designs because in the long term it will be old fashion; create a design that would last a long time.</p>
<p>8.Go though your design carefully till there are no mistakes. Ex-prototyping my website so that it can function properly, great responsive web. This applies to web base design detailing within the codes and the future I would fine ways to have my website to be more responsive.</p>
<p>9.Create the product that is long lasting. Ex- Creating a personal logo for branding myself. Having a good logo design from the start will be long lasting with in my career and in hopes for the future only need to change it when necessary.</p>
<p>10.Simple design is better than one that looks busy and harder to read on. Ex- creating a sign when cars drive past it. Having a simple design implies to a sign to be read easily and fast because there is only a few seconds to be interested in it or not. </p>
